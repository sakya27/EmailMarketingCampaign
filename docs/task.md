AI CHALLENGE:

Your task is to create an "email marketing content assistant". The user types certain parameters and criteria about their business and campaign goals, and your system will recommend 5 emails that the customer can use. You can leverage any AI/ML models or APIs to get this task done. it's your time to shine!

OPTIONAL BONUS task: Your system will miss the brand tone and voice of the customer. You can ask the user to type their website and twitter, so you can fine tune your model by scrapping customer data such as social posts or website content.

note: if you are backend focus let me know and can send an updated challenge. Basically, you can skip the UI part and just focus on building the APIs that returns the data recommendations.

Deadline, 5 days from now. Send a link to a PRIVATE Github repo named "recommender" and a production link deployed on Vercel, netifly, etc.

Let me know if you are in or if you have any questions.
